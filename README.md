# jspatterns
Basic application development

# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org) and NPM (both should come with it).
2. Install global node dev dependencies (gulp.js and Bower): `npm install -g gulp bower`.
3. Install local node dev dependencies: `npm install` from the jspatterns repo directory.
4. Install local front end dev dependencies: `bower install` from the jspatterns repo directory.

## Building the project

1. Run `gulp build` or just `gulp` (the default task is build) from the jspatterns repo directory.

## Running the project

1. Run `gulp serve` from the jspatterns repo directory (the app will open in your default browser when the command finishes and any file changes will refresh it automatically).
